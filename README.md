This informatics (INFO 498F) project is based off of a dataset of death rates for the top leading causes of death in the United States, including mortality patterns from 1999 through 2013, and by state of residence for selected year and cause of death.

The data was collected and published by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and accessed through data.gov.

The dataset can be found through this [data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-adjusted-death-rates-for-the-top-10-leading-causes-of-death-united-states-2013/resource/0e603f1d-31bf-4809-8f10-a994b305b379) link.

##Our analysis

During our project, we sought to answer four major questions:

- What have been the leading causes of death in order from 1999 to 2013?
- What causes of death have grown the most in the past 14 years from 1999 to 2013?
- What causes of death have declined the most in the past 14 years from 1999 to 2013?
- What is the proportional relation between causes of death most recently? How has it changed in the past 14 years from 1999 to 2013

We chose to answer these questions with multiple data visualizations. To summarize our findings, we found that the leading causes of deaths in total from 1999 to 2013 included Cancer and Disease of Heart, with Pneumonitis and Parkinson's Disease as the lowest.

From 1999 to 2013, Alzeihmer's Disease grew the most with 40,231 more deaths in 2013 than 1999; Diseases of Heart declined the most with 114,087 deaths less in 2013 than 1999.

During 1999, Cancer and Diseases of Heart accounted for over 60% of deaths - 27.1% and 35.8% respectively. During 2013, both causes still accounted for over 57% of deaths - 28.2% and 29.4% respectively.
